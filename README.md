## What I'm building

Sri Lanka is one of the best places to volunteer in the world. In fact Sri Lanka has the highest rate of volunteering in the world according to the <a href="https://www.unv.org/Our-stories/Facilitating-dialogue-volunteerism-and-inclusion-Sri-Lanka">UN Volunteers</a>.

> Sri Lanka has the highest rate of volunteering in the world. Each year
> an average of around seven million people volunteered their time,
> nearly half of those aged over 15 in the country.
> ---CAF World Giving Index


But finding a project to volunteer is not so easy. Mainly because different hosts publish their projects on their own websites and facebook pages and they are scattered everywhere. So I wanted to come up with a common place to list down all the volunteering opportunities in Sri Lanka so that anyone could easily find and work in projects. 


## How I built it

**[Initial Update]**<br>
I'm using VueJS as the frontend framework and Firebase as the backend (for now). The initial Stage is published and it just lists down the opportunities. It's still under constructions and I'm willing to add the following features soon.
- A way to submit opportunities ‚úÖ
- Notify a host when the project is submitted. (Using Twillio) ‚úÖ
- A search function to search through oppotinities ‚úÖ
- Notifications for the users when a new opportunity gets listed. ‚öíÔ∏è

**[Update 2]**<br>
Now VolunteerME can accept submissions from anyone just by filling out the submissions form. I used Vee-Validate for form handling and It was a total nightmare. üòÖ They made huge changes in Vee-Validate 3 and docs are jumbled with previous version and the latest version. Finally I learned how to use v3 and Im going to write a separate guide for that later on Dev.
Firebase is integrated as the backend. I just love how the subscriptions work!

**[Update 3]**<br>
VolunteerME now sends whatsapp messages using Twilio's APIs when you submit an event to the system. But Sadly I haven't submitted my template to Whatsapp and got the approval. Untill then, this feature wont work. I used a Firebase Cloud funcion to send whatsapp message. Although it needed my project to be upgraded to Blaze plan, it was the easiest way to do this (for me!). You can find the source code for the cloud function <a href="https://github.com/Suvink/volunteerme-functions">here.</a> Now I have to work on the UI of the project. I'm really bad at content writing but gonna give this a try and see how it turns up. Cheers!

**[Update 4]**<br>
Finally VolunteerME is now fully functional! Added the search feature so the users can filter oppotunities by their preffered location.
But there is a small bug in the form. It doesnt reset on submit. Still Couldnt any solution for that. Not even in Stack Overflow.
If someone know a solution please comment below! TIA!. Writing content wasn't smooth because I not very good with that. Thought of asking someone for help but then I decided to do it on my own. <br>
The approval process for Whatsapp template is kinda too long and I decided to add another email notfication as well.
